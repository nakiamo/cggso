      <description>This year we are looking for papers by graduate and undergraduate students that address the theme of this year’s symposium: “Renewing Connections: How the Past Informs the Present.” The adage, “If we ignore the past, we are bound to repeat it,” defines many of the threats to human rights that are occurring all over the world.

      <description>Graduate Student Organization In collaboration with the Cultural Studies Program, GSWS graduate certificate students have formed a joint GSO (CGGSO). The CGGSO works closely with the leadership of both programs to shape and publicize opportunities for graduate students. Currently, the CGGSO organizes a dissertation writing group, a works-in-progress series, and an annual graduate students symposium of Cultural Studies &amp;amp; Gender, Sexuality, and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies. For information, email cggso@pitt.edu.</description>
